## üöß Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Neo4j Learning Curve** - Mitigation: Start with simple queries, use online tutorials
2. **Data Modeling Complexity** - Mitigation: Keep initial schema simple, iterate
3. **Graph Visualization Performance** - Mitigation: Limit node count, use sampling for large graphs

### Contingency Plans
- **Fallback Database**: If Neo4j proves challenging, use NetworkX in-memory graphs
- **Simplified Dashboard**: Basic matplotlib plots if Streamlit integration fails
- **Mock Demo Data**: Pre-calculated results if real-time simulation doesn't work
