# APAC Pharma Supply Chain Ontology Model (Mini Supply Chain Digital Twin)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Build an ontology-driven supply chain digital twin that integrates multiple data sources into a unified view for decision-making, mimicking Palantir Foundry's approach with open-source tools.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Problem Statement

Traditional supply chain management systems operate in silos, making it difficult to:
- Understand cross-functional dependencies and relationships
- Simulate disruption impacts across the entire network
- Make data-driven decisions with real-time visibility
- Predict and mitigate risks before they cascade

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Approach

Create a **Mini Palantir-Style Supply Chain Control Tower** that demonstrates:

### 1. Unified Data Integration
- Connect disparate supply chain data sources (inventory, shipments, demand forecasts)
- Transform raw data into a coherent, queryable format
- Establish single source of truth for supply chain operations

### 2. Ontology-Driven Modeling
- Define entities: Assets (Products, Suppliers, Warehouses), Events (Shipments, Delays), Actors (Teams, Partners)
- Map relationships: "Warehouse stocks Product," "Shipment delayed by Supplier"
- Create semantic understanding of supply chain flows

### 3. Disruption Simulation & Analytics
- Model "what-if" scenarios (e.g., supplier delay propagation)
- Calculate business impact metrics (SLA drops, cost implications)
- Provide predictive insights for risk mitigation

### 4. Interactive Control Tower
- Real-time dashboards for operational visibility
- Drill-down capabilities from high-level KPIs to granular details
- Decision support tools for supply chain managers

## ðŸŽª Demonstration Outcomes

### Primary Use Case
**Scenario**: Supplier X experiences a 5-day delay
**Result**: System shows that APAC delivery SLA drops by 12%, affecting 847 customer orders across 3 regions

### Key Insights Generated
- Forecast vs actual demand variance analysis
- Inventory turnover optimization recommendations
- Supplier risk scoring based on historical performance
- Critical path identification for time-sensitive shipments

## ðŸš€ Success Criteria

1. **Functional Ontology**: Successfully model supply chain entities and relationships in graph format
2. **Disruption Propagation**: Demonstrate how delays cascade through the network
3. **Actionable Analytics**: Generate business-relevant KPIs and recommendations
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Enable stakeholders to explore scenarios and drill down into details
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Build foundation that can extend to real-world complexity

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

- **Supply Chain Managers**: Need visibility into network performance and risk factors
- **Operations Teams**: Require tools for day-to-day decision making
- **Executive Leadership**: Want strategic insights on supply chain optimization
- **Technical Teams**: Seeking modern, data-driven approaches to supply chain challenges

## ðŸ”„ Value Proposition

This project demonstrates **80% of enterprise-grade supply chain visibility** using open-source tools, providing:
- **Cost-effective alternative** to expensive enterprise solutions
- **Rapid prototyping capability** for supply chain digital transformation
- **Proof of concept** for ontology-driven operational intelligence
- **Foundation for AI/ML integration** in supply chain optimization

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact Potential

- **Risk Reduction**: Early identification of supply chain vulnerabilities
- **Cost Optimization**: Data-driven inventory and logistics decisions
- **SLA Improvement**: Proactive management of delivery commitments
- **Strategic Planning**: Better understanding of supplier dependencies and alternatives
